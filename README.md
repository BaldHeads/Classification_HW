# Classification_HW

## In these notebooks, different classification models are compared across different metrics: accuracy, recall, and geometric mean. 

Models compared:
 - Simple Logistic Regression
 - Random Oversampling
 - Cluster Centroid
 - SMOTE & SMOTEENN
 - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
 - Easy Ensemble Classifier
 
Sklearn and imblearn libraries are important for a wide variety of models and model analysis tools.

The ranks of feature importances are also observed with the balanced random forest classifier.
